# Playwright Web Testing Project

## Overview

This project is a Playwright-based automated testing framework designed to test various types of web elements. It provides a comprehensive set of tests for different web components, ensuring that your web application is functioning correctly across multiple browsers and platforms.

## Features

- **Cross-browser Testing**: Run tests on multiple browsers including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- **Element Interaction**: Test interactions with different web elements like buttons, links, forms, and more.
- **Responsive Design Testing**: Validate how your web elements respond across various screen sizes.
- **Page Navigation**: Automate page transitions and validate their behavior.
- **Assertion Library**: Built-in assertions to verify the state of web elements.
- **Code Quality**: Integrated ESLint for code linting and Prettier for code formatting.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend or modify tests to suit your specific needs.
- **Allure Reporting**: Integrated Allure for generating detailed test reports.
- **TypeScript Support**: Configured `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript features like decorators, strict type checking, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Allure Commandline](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_installing_a_commandline)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amsrocha2020/playwright-project.git
   cd playwright-web-testing
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or if you prefer yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Install Playwright browsers:

   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

4. Install Allure Report dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm i -D @playwright/test allure-playwright
   ```

5. Install Allure Commandline globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev
   ```

## TypeScript Configuration

This project uses TypeScript for static typing and modern JavaScript features. The `tsconfig.json` file is set up with the following options:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

### Key Configuration Options:

- **`target`**: Specifies the ECMAScript target version. `es6` ensures compatibility with modern browsers.
- **`module`**: Defines the module system. `commonjs` is used for Node.js environments.
- **`experimentalDecorators`**: Enables support for experimental decorators, useful for adding metadata or behavior to classes and methods.
- **`emitDecoratorMetadata`**: (Optional) Allows emitting metadata for decorated classes and methods, enabling reflection capabilities.
- **`allowSyntheticDefaultImports`**: Facilitates importing modules with a default export more intuitively.
- **`strict`**: Enables strict type-checking options to catch potential errors at compile time.

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
npx playwright test src/tests/example.spec.ts
```

To run tests in a specific browser:

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
```

## Viewing Reports

### Allure Report

Generate and view an Allure report after running the tests:

1. Generate the Allure report:

   ```bash
   npx allure generate ./allure-results --clean
   ```

2. Open the Allure report:

   ```bash
   npx allure open ./allure-report
   ```

### Playwright's Built-in Report

To view the test results using Playwright's built-in report:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Code Quality

This project uses **ESLint** for maintaining code quality and **Prettier** for consistent code formatting.

### Running ESLint

To check for linting errors:

```bash
npx eslint .
```

### Running Prettier

To format the code:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

You can also integrate ESLint and Prettier with your IDE for real-time linting and formatting.

## Important Points to Remember

- **Assertions in Spec Files**: Always do all assertions in your spec files, not in the Page Object classes. This keeps your tests clean and your page objects focused on interaction logic.

- **Page Interactions in Page Objects**: All page interactions, including locators, should reside in Page Object files. Avoid placing locators directly in spec files to maintain separation of concerns.

- **Use Playwright's `expect` Assertions**: Playwright's `expect` assertions should be preferred over generic assertions like `toBe`. Playwright's built-in error handling provides better debugging and error messages.

- **Leverage Fixtures**: Fixtures are extremely useful for setting up and tearing down tests, especially for sharing state between different tests.

- **Component-Based Page Objects**: Utilize a component-based approach for Page Objects. For example, create page component classes for common elements like tables, which can be reused across multiple pages. This reduces code duplication. Check out this [discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/1604#issuecomment-1004711489) for more insights.

- **Parametrize and Dynamically Generate Tests**: Donâ€™t hesitate to parametrize tests or dynamically generate them for repetitive testing scenarios. If you need to validate the same behavior across multiple pages, use an object and loop through it rather than duplicating the test code.

## Project Structure

- **`tests/`**: Contains all test files.
- **`pages/`**: Page Object Model (POM) classes that encapsulate web elements and page interactions.
- **`fixtures/`**: Setup and teardown scripts for reusable test setup.
- **`playwright.config.ts`**: Configuration file for Playwright.
- **`.eslintrc.js`**: Configuration file for ESLint.
- **`.prettierrc`**: Configuration file for Prettier.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file with compiler options.

## Writing Tests

Tests are written using Playwright's API and TypeScript. Below is a basic example of a test:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('should display correct page title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  expect(await page.title()).toBe('Example Domain');
});
```

## Customizing Tests

You can extend the framework by adding new tests, modifying existing ones, or creating new Page Object Models. Simply follow the structure provided in the `tests/` and `pages/` directories.
